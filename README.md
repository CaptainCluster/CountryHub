A program that gives the user information about a country they want to search. The information is based on the data provided by restcountries.com API.

The program takes data from a url that is partially determined by the user input (the country which we want to find data from). The program fetches the
data, processes it and then displays that processed data. The API URL, when searched by country, has issues when trying to search information about 
People's Republic of China. Normally it would display Taiwan on the HTML so changes to the code had to be made to guarantee information can be searched
conveniently regarding both of the countries.
